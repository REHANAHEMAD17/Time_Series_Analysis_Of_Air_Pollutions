# Time_Series_Analysis_Of_Air_Pollutions
📈 Time Series Analysis of Air Pollution
This repository presents a comprehensive time series analysis of air pollution data with the objective of understanding long-term trends, seasonal variations, and forecasting future pollution levels. The project applies statistical and machine learning techniques to real-world environmental data.

🧾 Overview
Air pollution poses significant risks to public health and the environment. Analyzing pollution levels over time can support better urban planning, policy-making, and health interventions.

This project involves:

Cleaning and preprocessing raw air quality data

Visualizing temporal trends in pollutant concentrations

Applying time series decomposition and statistical tests

Building forecasting models (ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, etc.)
